# Inventory System/ Store
Program I made in Sept-Oct 2022 for my advanced programming class. Utilized Inheritance and OOP to create a store/inventory system in which one can add items, delete items, 
edit item specifs such as price, quantity, name, and purchase items (resulting in a change in quantity). Various exceptions are used to prevent bad user input.
